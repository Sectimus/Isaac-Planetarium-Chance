[h1]Configuring the HUD offset:[/h1]
[b][u]If you use an alternative HUD offset than the one provided by default in the options menu, pause your game by pressing "ESC" - whilst you are in the pause menu, press "K" or "L" respectively to decrease / increase the hud offset for the planetarium icon.[/u][/b]
This is due to a limitation in the modding API, where mods cannot read the options.ini file or access any variable that contains the in-game HUD offset value.

Make sure you have the requirements unlocked to be able to actually see the planetarium.

Bear in mind 99.9% doesn't guarantee a spawn: "Note that the bonuses are additive (not multiplicative) and can reach 100%. However, only an attempt by the game to generate a Planetarium is guaranteed: they have the lowest priority in level generation and if the level does not have enough space, the room will not be placed. However, the bonus will remain intact for a later level if any remain." - https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Planetarium
