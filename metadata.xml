    <description>Displays the chance of a planetarium being present (on the current floor) in the HUD. Takes into account all items, collectibles and modifiers.

[b][u]----------READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE COMMENTING!!!----------[/u][/b]

[i]items that affect the chance of a planetarium spawn will not show until you enter the next floor, as your current floor layout will not change.[/i]

[h1]Configuring the HUD offset:[/h1]

    1: Start a run
    2: [u]Do not[/u] have your game paused in any way (debug menu / pause screen etc.)
    3: Press "[b]shift+J[/b]" or "[b]shift+K[/b]" to decrease / increase the hud offset

This is due to a limitation in the modding API, where mods cannot read the options.ini file or access any variable that contains the in-game HUD offset value. An integration with mod config menu will be coming soon™

Make sure you have the requirements unlocked to be able to actually see the planetarium.

Bear in mind 99.9% doesn't guarantee a spawn: "Note that the bonuses are additive (not multiplicative) and can reach 100%. However, only an attempt by the game to generate a Planetarium is guaranteed: they have the lowest priority in level generation and if the level does not have enough space, the room will not be placed. However, the bonus will remain intact for a later level if any remain." - https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Planetarium
